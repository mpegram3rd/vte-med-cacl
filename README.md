# A Vibe Coded Improved Risk Score for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)

This calculator was vibe coded based off the original calculator created bty Dr. Alex C Spyropoulos which can be found here: https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/10349/improve-risk-score-venous-thromboembolism-vte

## Disclaimer
I would highly recommend using his calculator as it comes from a more reliable, trusted resource than what is represented here.  

I was curious about what it was like to do some vibe coding and thought this was a nice simple project to do it. All the code provided was generated and I will note that there are definitely some aspects of the code that I don't agree with from an implementation standpoint (so don't hold it against me. üòÅ)
